Welcome to Goutham's Portfolio! This project showcases my work, skills, and projects in Python programming and development.
Portfolio Website
This README file provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and running a portfolio website built using the Flask web framework. The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and SQLAlchemy ORM for database management. The key feature of this portfolio is an interactive skills section where a double-click on a skill image opens a small description of the skill. Additionally, the website tracks details of resume downloads, including the IP address and user agent of the downloader,visiting time and contact details like name,email,message .
